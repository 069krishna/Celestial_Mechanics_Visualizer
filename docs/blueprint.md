# **App Name**: Celestial Mechanics Visualizer

## Core Features:

- Orbital Visualization: Render an interactive 2D simulation of Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun, showcasing Earth's rotation on its axis and revolution around the sun, adhering to the correct orbital tilt (23.5Â°).
- Time Control: Implement a time control slider with preset speeds (1 day/sec, 1 month/sec, etc.) to adjust the pace of the simulation.
- Mode Selection: Include toggles to switch between revolution-only and rotation + revolution modes.
- Information Display: Display the current simulated date and Earth's position in orbit (e.g., Spring Equinox).
- Mathematical Accuracy: Use mathematical models and trigonometric principles to accurately simulate the Earth's movement, ensuring solstices and equinoxes are depicted correctly.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep space blue (#293462) evoking the vastness of space and the mystery of celestial movements. Chosen to provide a clear backdrop that enhances the visibility of the Earth and Sun in the simulation.
- Background color: Dark midnight blue (#12182B), a desaturated tone that reduces eye strain and enhances the contrast with the bright simulation elements.
- Accent color: Golden yellow (#EBC04B), drawing focus to interactive elements such as the time control slider and toggle buttons. Provides visual interest, reminiscent of starlight.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif for clean and modern readability in UI elements and descriptive text. Its neutrality and clarity ensure that information such as dates and orbital positions are easily accessible and understandable.
- Use minimalistic line icons to represent controls and simulation elements, ensuring they are intuitive and visually unobtrusive. The icons should maintain clarity to avoid detracting from the main simulation.
- Employ a clean, centered layout to focus user attention on the simulation. Interactive elements should be neatly arranged to reduce clutter and optimize user experience, following established best practices for UI/UX design.
- Incorporate smooth transitions and subtle animations for changes in time or display modes. This design enhances the interactive experience, making it more engaging and immersive without causing distractions.
